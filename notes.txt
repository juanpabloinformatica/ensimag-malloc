Tp notes
 -> basically the goal is remake in a certain way
    -> malloc : allocate heap memory and return a pointer
    -> free : remove that allocated memory
-> Marquage des blocs
    -> initOfZone
        -> taille -> 8o 
        -> magic -> 8o
    -> finalOfZone
        -> taille -> 8o 
        -> magic -> 8o
    -> taille = initOfZone + [utilisateur + delta] + finalOfZone
-> Calcul magic:
-> mem small
    -> so what was important to know here
    -> For writting memory addresses u need to do so
    -> in a void* variable.
    -> Is important to know that the compiler need
       need to know how many bytes it needs to consider
       that's why casting is important
    ->
